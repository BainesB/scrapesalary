This is a script that grabs the the Daily Grose pay and Daily take home pay from the salary calculator. 

It may be frigile. I've used xpath. So It works on 2018, but if the owner of the site updates the way their table displays it will break this code. 

I've included the .db file, to save myself or anyone else running the script again against their web site. 

If the is not 2018, then to get realiable numbers you will have to run the code again to get an uptodate db.


Done! :-)
